                        <h2>3D Modeling:</h2>
                        <img src="images/FreeFlying.jpg" alt="First Model">
                        <p>This is a picture of one of the first models I ever made. It was created with software called 'Animation Master'. I no londer have the model itself, but somehow kept this image through the years.</p>
                        <img src="images/Dragon01.png" alt="Dragon Model">
                        <p>In college, I put together this humanoid dragon model. Then I rigged and animated it. Finally, I was able to use the schools 3D printer to print it out. Unfortunately, I don't have any images of the printed model, but this is how I learn about 3D printing initially.</p>
                        <img src="images/VVCarrierLayout01.jpg" alt="Carrier Model">
                        <p>After college, I made a few more models just for practice. A couple years later, me and a couple other guys threw some money together and purchased our own 3D printer.</p>

                        <h2>3D Printing:</h2>
                        <img src="images/6.jpg" alt="Ball Model">
                        <p>I've printed all kinds of models over the last several years. The image above was a piece printed to test out pushing the limits of what detail could be achieved. The first few layers were not printing correctly until the flow was adjusted.</p>
                        <img src="images/3.jpg" alt="Skull Model 1">
                        <img src="images/2.jpg" alt="Skull Model 2">
                        <p>This piece was done to test new modeling techniques that allowed me to combine multiple pre-existing models, and to create the hole running through the model. (I spray painted the models after they printed)</p>
                        <img src="images/3D_Print01.png" alt="Rat Skull Model">
                        <p>A friend of mine asked if I could fix a broken bad clip, so I downloaded a model of a rat skull and remodeled it to hold the spring from the bag clip. It turned out very well.</p>

                        <h2>Arduino:</h2>
                        <img src="images/4.jpg" alt="Arduino 1">
                        <p>I've only started to tinker with Arduino, but this project went very well. I wanted to add some lights to my friend's snowboarding helmet. The picture above was a good prototype, but was way to big to fit in the helmet.</p>
                        <img src="images/ArduinoVisor01.png" alt="Arduino 2">
                        <p>I was able to get rid of the 'bread board' by soldering all of the individual pieces together with much shorted wire. I fit it all into a custom case I 3D printed.</p>

                        <p>Once the lights were mounted, he could flip a switchto turn on the lights and they would blink back and forth.</p>
